This Repo contain the implementation of Linear Regression On Bostion DataSet 

Linear Regression. Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables
by fitting a linear equation to observed data. ... A linear regression line 
has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable.

The name for this dataset is simply boston. It has two prototasks: nox, in which the nitrous oxide level is to be predicted; and price, in which the median value of a home is to be predicted

# DataSet
## Miscellaneous Details
 ### Origin
 The origin of the boston housing data is Natural.
### Usage
This dataset may be used for Assessment.
### Number of Cases
The dataset contains a total of 506 cases.
### Order
The order of the cases is mysterious.
### Variables
There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:
#### CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
#### ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
#### INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
#### CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
#### NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
#### RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
#### AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
#### DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
#### RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
#### TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
#### PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
#### B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
#### LSTAT - % lower status of the population
#### MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000
## Note

Variable #14 seems to be censored at 50.00 (corresponding to a median price of $50,000); Censoring is suggested by the fact that the highest median price of exactly $50,000 is reported in 16 cases, while 15 cases have prices between $40,000 and $50,000, with prices rounded to the nearest hundred. Harrison and Rubinfeld do not mention any censoring.
